NOTICE:

This code is not intended for solving Project Euler problems.

This is simply a way for me to store the code I used to solve the problems, all while learning how to use github.

DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR PROJECT EULER!


Using this code defeats the purpose, as you wouldn't have learned anything.

However, if you happen to stumble across this, if you have any helpful contributions to make, feel free to do so.


~~~~~~~Other Notes~~~~~~~~

COMPATIBILITY:

	Unless otherwise noted, all python files were written to work with the 3.4.1 release of python.
